# Block Drop Survival

**Block Drop Survival** is a simple 2D game where the player avoids falling obstacles while collecting power-ups. The game increases in difficulty over time, making it progressively more challenging as the player survives longer. Power-ups include Shield, Health, and Slow-Motion, which can aid the player in surviving longer against the Block Drop Survival.

## üéÆ Play the Game
You can play the WebGL version of the game online: [**Play Block Drop Survival (WebGL)**](https://play.unity.com/en/games/b501f302-ca2d-41de-a977-485822516f75/block-drop-survival)
